# About Me

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, world! My name is Shary (pronounced 'sha-ree'), and I am a computer science graduate student and content creator, taking one step at a time to build my version of the world. My coding projects are inspired by the courses I have taken at Fort Hays State University, and I have many more exciting projects on the way.

ðŸ“š I am a perpetual learner, always on the lookout for new skills and focused on making daily progress rather than chasing perfection.

ðŸ’» Computer science is my passion, and I love connecting with like-minded individuals who share the same enthusiasm for technology and coding.

ðŸŒŸ My ultimate goal is to gain valuable hands-on training in a tech company, contributing my skills and learning from the best in the field.

ðŸŽ® In my free time, you will often find me immersed in a good book or enjoying video games!

Feel free to explore my repositories, connect with me, or reach out if you share similar interests or if there is an opportunity for collaboration. Let us learn and grow together!
